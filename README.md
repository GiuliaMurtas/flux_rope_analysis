# flux_rope_analysis

This repository collects a set of script for the analysis of unstable flux ropes.

The script "energy_components.py" integrates the energy terms across the volume and show the global contribution of each component.

The script "current_density_frames.py" saves frames of the current density magnitude captured at the centre of the flux rope.
