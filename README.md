# flux_rope_analysis

This repository collects a set of scripts employed for the analysis of kink unstable flux ropes.

The script "energy_components.py" integrates the energy terms across the volume and allow to plot the global contribution of each component.

The script "current_density_frames.py" saves frames of the current density magnitude captured at the centre of the flux rope.

The script "ionrec.py" produces a 1D plot of the global ionization/recombination rates in PIP (partially ionized plasmas) simulations as a function of time.
